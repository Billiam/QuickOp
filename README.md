# QuickOp

QuickOp is a simple to use utility for generating GCODE for simple, one-off CNC operations.

Frequently, you may need to do a facing or drilling operating but doing so in something like Fusion 360 requires modeling the stock as well. QuickOp aims to alliveiate that by giving you a simple to use utility that will generate generic GCODE quickly.
